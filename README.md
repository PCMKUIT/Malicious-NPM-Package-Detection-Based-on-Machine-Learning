# Malicious-NPM-Package-Detection-Based-on-Machine-Learning
This project proposes a machine learning-based approach for detecting malicious NPM packages through static analysis of package metadata and source code features. The goal is to enhance the security of the NPM ecosystem by automatically identifying potentially harmful packages before they reach users.
The rapid growth of the open-source ecosystem, particularly the Node Package Manager (NPM) registry, has made software development faster and more convenient. However, this openness also introduces security risks, as malicious actors can upload harmful packages containing obfuscated or malicious code that may compromise usersâ€™ systems or steal sensitive information. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based approach to detect malicious NPM packages automatically. By extracting both basic and advanced features from package metadata, source code structure, and behavioral indicators, the system can classify packages as benign or malicious. The proposed method leverages static analysis techniques combined with supervised learning models to improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives, helping enhance the security of the NPM ecosystem.
